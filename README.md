# AACD_01_AndroidCore_02_JobScheduler
App to study for AACD (Associate Android Developer Certification). This app is a implementation of the following Android Codelab: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-job-scheduler/index.html#0

This repo will:
  - Implement a JobService that delivers a simple notification to let the user know the job is running.
  - Get user input to configure constraints (such as waiting until the device is charging) on the JobService.
  - Schedule the job using JobScheduler.
  
At the end of this app I've learned:
  - How to implement a JobService.
  - How to construct a JobInfo object with specific constraints.
  - How to schedule a JobService based on the JobInfo object.
